Run **Milvus** on Kubernetes through [OpenEverest](https://github.com/openeverest/openeverest),
backed by the [Milvus Operator](https://github.com/zilliztech/milvus-operator).

## What this is

OpenEverest providers translate a single, technology-agnostic `Instance` custom resource into
the native custom resources of an upstream Kubernetes operator — for databases, but equally
for caches, message queues, object storage, or model-serving runtimes. This repository is the
provider for `<technology>`: it owns the technology-specific knowledge — topologies, versions,
parameters, backup wiring — so that users, the API server, and the UI stay technology-agnostic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This provider is not standalone.** It requires an OpenEverest installation (core CRDs and
> controller) in the cluster. Installing this chart on its own does nothing.
> See [Install OpenEverest](https://openeverest.io/documentation/current/quick-install.html).

```

The provider watches `Instance` resources whose `spec.providerRef.name` is
`milvus`, and reports workload health back onto `Instance.status`. It never
manages pods directly — all lifecycle work is delegated to the operator.

## Compatibility

<!-- TODO(provider): keep this table accurate for every release. -->

| provider-milvus | OpenEverest | Operator | Kubernetes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0.1.x` | `>= 2.0.0` | `1.3.9` | `1.30` – `1.34` |

## Capabilities

<!-- TODO(provider): the rows below are the standard set across all OpenEverest providers.
     Keep the wording of the rows you use identical so providers stay comparable, and delete
     the rows that make no sense for this technology rather than marking them unsupported. -->

What you can do to a running instance through the `Instance` API. Upgrading the
provider itself is covered under [Installation](#installation).

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Provisioning | ✅ | Standalone and cluster topologies |
| Horizontal scaling | ✅ | Per-component replica counts |
| Vertical scaling (CPU / memory) | ✅ | Per-component resource limits |
| Version upgrades | ✅ | `spec.version`; the operator performs the rolling update |
| Custom configuration | ✅ | Milvus engine config via component `parameters.configuration` |
| Authentication | ✅ | A `root` credential is generated and published to the connection Secret |
| Network exposure | ✅ | ClusterIP, NodePort or LoadBalancer via the component `service` |
| Pod scheduling | ✅ | Per-component `schedulingPolicy` (affinity, tolerations, node selector, topology spread, scheduler); not applied to bundled dependencies |
| Pod customization | ✅ | Per-component `parameters.pod`: annotations, env, volumes, volume mounts, container security context, init containers |
| Monitoring | ✅ | Prometheus: a PodMonitor for the Milvus components via `topology.parameters.monitoring.prometheus`; requires the Prometheus Operator |
| TLS | ❌ | |

Stateful workloads additionally report:

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent storage | ✅ | Object storage (MinIO) sized via the component `storage` |
| Storage expansion | ❌ | |
| Backups (on demand) | ❌ | |
| Backups (scheduled) | ❌ | |
| Point-in-time recovery | ❌ | |
| Restore | ❌ | |

## Installation

<!-- TODO(provider): confirm the published chart coordinates (org/repo) match where you publish. -->

The provider chart is published as an OCI artifact:

```bash
helm install provider-milvus \
  oci://ghcr.io/openeverest/charts/provider-milvus \
  --version <chart-version> \
  --namespace everest-system
```

- The Milvus operator is bundled as a chart dependency and is installed automatically.

Upgrade and uninstall:

```bash
helm upgrade provider-milvus oci://ghcr.io/openeverest/charts/provider-milvus
helm uninstall provider-milvus --namespace everest-system
```

Uninstalling the chart does **not** delete running `Instance` resources or their data.

## Usage

Verify that the provider registered itself:

```bash
kubectl get providers.core.openeverest.io milvus
```

Create an instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.openeverest.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instance
metadata:
  name: milvus-standalone
spec:
  providerRef:
    name: milvus
  topology:
    type: standalone          # optional; standalone is the default
  components:
    standalone:
      type: milvus
      replicas: 1
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: "1"
          memory: 4Gi
      storage:
        size: 10Gi
```

Component names are defined by this provider — see [definition/provider.yaml](definition/provider.yaml).
`spec.version` and `spec.topology` are optional; the provider defaults apply. More
examples (including a full cluster topology) live in [examples/](examples/).

Watch it come up:

```bash
kubectl get instance milvus-standalone -w
```

### Connect

Authentication is enabled by default. On first boot the provider generates a
random password for the built-in `root` user and publishes the connection
details to the Secret referenced by `.status.connectionSecretRef` (named
`milvus-standalone-conn`):

```bash
# host, port, username, password, uri and a ready-to-use root:<password> token
kubectl get secret milvus-standalone-conn \
  -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{$k}}={{$v | base64decode}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'
```

From your workstation, port-forward the service and connect with pymilvus:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/milvus-standalone-milvus 19530:19530
```

```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient

client = MilvusClient(uri="http://localhost:19530", token="root:<password>")
client.create_collection("demo", dimension=8)
```

### Expose it outside the cluster

Set the service type on the client-facing component (`standalone` for standalone,
`proxy` for cluster). The connection details then report the external address
automatically:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
    standalone:
      type: milvus
      service:
        serviceType: LoadBalancer   # or NodePort
      storage:
        size: 10Gi
```

- **ClusterIP** (default) — reachable only inside the cluster.
- **LoadBalancer** — the connection host is the load balancer address once assigned.
- **NodePort** — the connection host is a node address paired with the assigned node port.

### Customize component pods

`parameters.pod` adds pod-level settings to one component, e.g. to attach an
SR-IOV/RDMA secondary network to the query nodes:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
    queryNode:
      type: milvus
      resources:
        limits:
          nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
          rdma/hca: "1"
      parameters:
        pod:
          annotations:
            k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: sriov-rdma
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add: ["IPC_LOCK"]
```

`volumes`, `securityContext` and `initContainers` take Kubernetes objects and
are validated when the instance is reconciled.

### Split a component across node pools

`parameters.groups` runs `proxy`, `dataNode`, `queryNode` or `streamingNode` as
several independently placed workloads, e.g. query nodes on two GPU models.
Groups inherit the component's image, resources and pod settings; the
component's `replicas`, when set, must equal the groups' total:

```yaml
spec:
  components:
    queryNode:
      type: milvus
      replicas: 6
      parameters:
        groups:
          - name: l40s
            replicas: 4
            nodeSelector:
              nvidia.com/gpu.product: NVIDIA-L40S
          - name: h200
            replicas: 2
            nodeSelector:
              nvidia.com/gpu.product: NVIDIA-H200
```

### Bring your own etcd and object storage

Point Milvus at existing services instead of the bundled ones. With `useIAM`
the pods authenticate through the ServiceAccount's cloud identity (e.g. EKS
IRSA), so no credentials Secret is needed. `rootPath` lets several instances
share one etcd or bucket and cannot be changed after creation:

```yaml
spec:
  topology:
    type: cluster
    parameters:
      dependencies:
        etcd:
          external: true
          endpoints: ["etcd-0.etcd:2379", "etcd-1.etcd:2379", "etcd-2.etcd:2379"]
          rootPath: vectors-prod
        storage:
          external: true
          type: S3
          endpoint: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443
          useSSL: true
          bucket: vectors
          region: us-east-1
          cloudProvider: aws
          useIAM: true
          serviceAccountName: milvus-s3
```

### Scrape metrics with Prometheus

With the [Prometheus Operator](https://prometheus-operator.dev) in the cluster,
enable Prometheus to get a PodMonitor (`<instance>-metrics`) that scrapes every
Milvus component on its `metrics` port. `podMonitorLabels` lets your Prometheus
`podMonitorSelector` pick it up; `interval` defaults to the Prometheus global
scrape interval. Turning it off removes the PodMonitor. The bundled etcd, MinIO
and Pulsar are not scraped.

```yaml
spec:
  topology:
    type: standalone
    parameters:
      monitoring:
        prometheus:
          enabled: true
          interval: 30s
          podMonitorLabels:
            release: kube-prometheus-stack
```

## Topologies

<!-- TODO(sdk): these blocks are hand-maintained until `provider-sdk generate` fills them
     from definition/. Until then, update them whenever definition/ changes. -->

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: topologies -->
| Topology | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `standalone` | ✅ | Single-process Milvus; smallest footprint, ideal for experimentation |
| `cluster` | | Independently scalable components; Woodpecker (default) or Pulsar as the message stream |
<!-- END GENERATED: topologies -->

## Versions

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: versions -->
| Version bundle | Default |  |
|---|---|---|
| `2.6.15` | | |
| `2.6.15-gpu` | | GPU build of every component |
| `2.6.11` | ✅ | |
| `2.6.10` | | |
<!-- END GENERATED: versions -->

Source of truth: [definition/versions.yaml](definition/versions.yaml).

GPU bundles only switch images; request GPUs per component with
`resources.limits["nvidia.com/gpu"]` and place the pods with `schedulingPolicy`.
`spec.components.<name>.image` overrides a single component's image (e.g. a
registry mirror); components on different images are updated all at once
instead of in the operator's dependency order.

<!-- TODO(provider): document the supported upgrade paths (minor only? operator first?). -->

## Configuration

- **Chart values:** [charts/provider-milvus/values.yaml](charts/provider-milvus/values.yaml)
- **Instance parameters:** per-component and per-topology `parameters` schemas, defined under
  [definition/](definition/) and published on the `Provider` resource
  (`kubectl get provider milvus -o yaml`). The API server and the UI validate
  user input against these schemas.

<!-- TODO(provider): call out the technology-specific knobs worth knowing about. -->

## Development

Requires Go (see [go.mod](go.mod)), Docker, Helm, kubectl, and a Kubernetes cluster you can
reach. [dev/README.md](dev/README.md) covers the environment end to end: the recommended
local k3d setup, running against a cluster you already have, and every `dev/.env` setting.

```bash
make dev-up             # local cluster + Tilt dev environment (see dev/README.md)
make generate           # RBAC, provider spec, Helm chart sync
make run                # run the provider locally against the cluster
make test-unit
make test-integration   # chainsaw suites under test/integration/
make dev-down
```

`make help` lists every target. `make verify` fails when generated files are stale — run
`make generate` and commit the result.

The provider contract (`Validate` / `Sync` / `Status` / `Cleanup`), RBAC markers, watches,
code generation, and the backup/restore interfaces are documented once for all providers in
[PROVIDER_DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/openeverest/provider-sdk/blob/main/PROVIDER_DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cmd/provider/` | Entry point |
| `internal/provider/` | `ProviderInterface` implementation, backup interfaces, RBAC markers |
| `internal/common/` | Component name constants |
| `definition/` | Provider identity, component types, versions, topologies, backup classes |
| `charts/provider-milvus/` | Helm chart (`generated/` is produced by `make generate`) |
| `config/rbac/role.yaml` | Generated `ClusterRole` — do not edit |
| `test/integration/` | Chainsaw suites (see its `README.md`) |
| `test/vars.sh` | Pinned operator and workload versions used by tests |
| `examples/` | Example `Instance` resources |
| `dev/` | Tilt dev environment, `.env` configuration, k3d cluster config |
| `.github/workflows/` | CI: lint, build, unit and integration tests, release |

### Testing

- **Unit tests** — `make test-unit`.
- **Integration tests** — chainsaw suites under `test/integration/`. The scaffolded `core/`
  suite is a skeleton: it verifies the provider deployment and includes commented-out
  lifecycle steps to enable as you implement the provider. See
  [test/integration/README.md](test/integration/README.md).
- **CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs lint, build, unit tests, generated-file
  verification, Helm lint, and each integration suite on every pull request.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
kubectl logs -n everest-system deploy/provider-milvus -f
```

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---|---|
| `Instance` stuck in `Creating` | `kubectl describe instance <name>` conditions, then the provider logs |
| No `Provider` resource in the cluster | Is the chart installed? Check the provider deployment logs |
| `Instance` ignored entirely | `spec.providerRef.name` must be `milvus` |
| Operator resource created but no pods | Inspect the operator's custom resource status — the failure is upstream |

<!-- TODO(provider): add technology-specific gotchas (sysctl limits, storage class or GPU
     requirements, node selectors, …). -->
